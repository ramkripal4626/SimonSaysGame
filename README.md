# Simon Game
Welcome to the Simon Game repository! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Says game. The game tests your memory by requiring you to repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors.

# Game Description
In the Simon Game, players must remember and replicate a sequence of colors generated by the game. With each round, the sequence gets longer, challenging the player's memory and concentration. Press any key to start the game and follow the color sequences as they light up.
